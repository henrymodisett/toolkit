# Touchstone — AI Agent Instructions

This file steers Codex and other AGENTS.md-native coding agents. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`; Gemini CLI reads `GEMINI.md`. Keep these files aligned when project-level workflow changes. When you are coding, follow the authoring guidance first. When you are explicitly reviewing a PR or running the AI review hook, use the review guide below.

## Touchstone — Shared Agent Steering

You are an AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, or another driving CLI) working in a Touchstone-bootstrapped project. This block is the universal contract: rules that apply on every turn, plus a routing table to deeper docs you should consult when specific triggers fire. Project-specific guidance lives outside this block in your driver's steering doc (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`).

## Purpose

**Humans approve plans. Agents write and ship code. GitHub reviews code.**

That division is the entire product; everything Touchstone ships exists to hold one of those three lines in place. No human reads a diff as a merge precondition, so machines are the whole quality bar.

GitHub's effective repository policy is the enforcement authority. Where the Touchstone policy is installed and verified, the protected validation workflow and required `review-gate` workflow must pass, every finding must be answered, every thread must be resolved, and native rules reject direct and force pushes and branch deletion; emergency admin bypass is limited to pull requests, where GitHub records it. Local hooks are fast feedback, not the boundary. Do not infer adoption from this document: inspect the repository's effective rules — and a repository without that enforcement still does not authorize a direct push.

**Review is always required, and `review-gate` is what represents it — not any one reviewer.** The AI reviewer reports `COMMENTED`, not `APPROVED`, so approval count does not represent it either. More than one reviewer can satisfy the gate: where the primary is unavailable, the pinned gate reviews the head itself. A green `review-gate` means the head was reviewed; the absence of a comment from a particular reviewer does not mean it was not. Read the check, not the commenter. Where that gate is absent, exact-head review remains mandatory driver procedure — a rollout gap, not permission to skip it.

**A reviewer quota notice is not a blocker and not a wait.** The pinned gate then reviews the head itself; answer what it reports with `pr answer --finding`.

To hold those lines, Touchstone does three things and nothing else:

1. **Constrain** — adopted GitHub policy blocks unsafe delivery; before adoption, the driver follows the same delivery contract and treats missing enforcement as a tracked gap.
2. **Make state legible** — what happened lives in git, PRs, and issues, verifiable without trusting your narration.
3. **Carry the contract** — the same rules reach every project and every agent, automatically.

Before adding anything here, name which of the three it serves; if you cannot, it does not belong. "Is it useful?" is not the test: does it constrain the agent, or merely serve it? Automating what you can already do (retrying a push, recovering a moved base) belongs in the project, not here: you are the recovery mechanism.

## Agent Roles And Fallbacks

- **Driving CLI** — Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI. Owns file edits, git state, tests, commits, PR creation, PR comment triage, fix commits, approval tracking, and merge. Drivers are interchangeable; driver fallback is shared-contract fallback — if one is unavailable, another reads the same files and continues.
- **PR-visible reviewer** — GitHub-hosted review runs asynchronously against the exact pushed head. It reports findings on the PR; it never owns local files, git state, validation, or merge authority.

## Engineering principles (always in mind)

Non-negotiable. Every code change is reviewed against them. Full rationale lives in `principles/engineering-principles.md`.

- **No band-aids** — fix the root cause; if patching a symptom, say so explicitly and name the root cause.
- **Keep interfaces narrow** — expose the smallest stable contract; don't leak storage shape, vendor SDKs, or workflow sequencing.
- **Derive limits from domain** — thresholds and sizes come from input/config/named constants; test at small, typical, and large scales.
- **Derive, don't persist** — compute from the source of truth; persist derived state only with documented invalidation + rebuild path.
- **No silent failures** — every exception is re-raised or logged with debug context. No `except: pass`, no swallowed errors.
- **Every retained fix gets a test** — its CI regression test fails on the old code; a test never validates a fix-created regression.
- **Think in invariants** — name and assert at least one invariant for nontrivial logic.
- **One code path** — share business logic across modes; confine mode-specific differences to adapters, config, or the I/O boundary.
- **Version your data boundaries** — when a model/algorithm/source change affects decisions, version the boundary; don't aggregate across.
- **Separate behavior changes from tidying** — never mix functional changes with broad renames, formatting sweeps, or unrelated refactors.
- **Make irreversible actions recoverable** — destructive operations need dry-run, backup, idempotency, rollback, or forward-fix plan before they run.
- **Preserve compatibility at boundaries** — public API/config/schema/CLI/hook/template changes need a compatibility or migration plan.
- **Audit weak-point classes** — find a structural bug → audit the class + add a guardrail. Use the `touchstone-audit-weak-points` skill (Claude) or read `principles/audit-weak-points.md` (other drivers).
- **File-writing subagents** — use worktrees; remove one only after final result delivery or confirmed cancellation.
- **File tracked bugs** — file bugs found here or upstream in the configured tracker; don't silently work around them.
- **Checkpoint scope expansion before editing** — a follow-up approves doing the work, not bundling it. Route independent additions pre-edit; file count alone never decides.
- **Keep review subordinate to scope** — review cannot amend approved scope. A review-fix defect stops patching. A second ends same-shape work. Three fix rounds follow the capability across replacement PRs; closing or renaming never resets the budget.
- **Stop when the task is correct** — deterministic gates first. **The badge is the bar: fix P0/P1; answer and route every P2, P3, or unbadged finding — never fix one here, and never reopen the design space.** **Exact-head review after a fix commit is never skipped** and never authorizes mutation past a stop.

## Never commit on the default branch

Before the first edit of a tracked file in a session, run `git branch --show-current`. If it reports the default branch (`main` or `master`), branch first with `git checkout -b <type>/<slug>` where `<type>` is `feat | fix | chore | refactor | docs`. Your unstaged changes carry over — there's no cost to switching now and a real cost to discovering at commit time. Recovery steps when it happens anyway live in `principles/git-workflow.md`.

## Required Delivery Workflow

Drive this lifecycle automatically; do not ask the user for permission at each step.

1. **Pull.** `git pull --rebase` on the default branch.
2. **Branch.** Before any edit that might become a commit.
3. **Claim tracked work before implementation.** GitHub: `touchstone tracker claim <ref>` (race-safe, verified by re-read). Linear: the adapter has no transport — assign yourself through the Linear MCP and re-read the assignee before editing. Claim every item in a bundle so two agents do not ship competing fixes; an unavailable transport is unverifiable, never success.
4. **Change + commit.** Stage explicit files. Normal: `touchstone review check`, then `touchstone review run`; reviewer down: waiver, never fallback; slice too big: re-slice, never waive. Run at most one tier-required local AI pass per coherent unit, none for trivial work, and never rerun to confirm fixes. One concern per commit. Run `git show --stat --oneline HEAD`; unchanged `HEAD`: do not ship.
5. **Local review handoff.** Normal: `openrouter on staged: <n> findings`. Serious: save `git rev-parse HEAD`; run `touchstone review run --base origin/<default>` once — Codex first, bounded fallback on any non-success; record `<reviewer> on <head-sha>: <n> findings, <disposition>`, waiving only if both are gone; never record the base. Hosted review owns exact heads.
6. **Reconcile tracked work.** Before opening the PR, list every tracker item found, claimed, fixed, partially fixed, or made stale. Fixed items get the configured closing reference in the PR body; partial or stale items get a tracker note explaining the evidence or remaining gap. Do not leave shipped work stale silently.
7. **Ship.** `git push -u origin HEAD`, then `touchstone pr open --expect-branch <branch> --title "<type>: <what>" --body-file <file>` — the installed CLI is the sequencer everywhere: it creates or reuses the PR, posts the review request, and confirms the exact head and base binding (re-running any declared gate). Put the configured closing reference (`Closes #123` or `Fixes AUT-123`) in the PR body, not only a commit. Re-run it for a later head (idempotent). **Never put the sequencer's marker in a comment you write yourself** — it reads that as a request for other coordinates and refuses to repair anything. A bare `@codex review` from a collaborator is valid only in recovery — bounded stalled-request recovery, or the CLI-absent raw sequence (`gh pr create`, the bare comment, then re-run any declared gate) — never the instruction.
8. **Answer every piece of PR feedback before merging.** Answering is not implementing; classify by scope *and severity*, then answer and route whatever you are not fixing. Stop widened work; allowed fixes follow the cascade and exact-head rules. Inspect GitHub's complete review surface, reply to each comment, and resolve every thread via `principles/git-workflow.md`; unresolved threads and `CHANGES_REQUESTED` block merge.
9. **Merge.** Once the head is pushed and bound, run `touchstone pr merge <n> --head <sha>` without polling for the gate: a successful gate enters the queue, a pending one arms auto-merge, a failed one is refused. A queue entry ends mutation; never dequeue or probe admin merge. Verified queue enforcement permits raw `gh pr merge <n> --squash --match-head-commit <sha>`; otherwise stop. The merge-group gate owns later feedback. Confirm state.
10. **Clean up before the session ends.** Remove everything this session created; leave sibling work untouched; make tracker terminal. `touchstone cleanup check` is repo-wide: resolve yours, route stale residue; its nonzero exit never authorizes deleting another session's work.

Raw commands are portable recovery; GitHub owns verdict and state. `principles/git-workflow.md` carries the full sequence, including thread resolution.

Never push directly to the default branch, even in an emergency; rewriting your own unmerged branch is fine. Audited policy enforces PR-only bypass; elsewhere it stays mandatory. See `principles/git-workflow.md`.

## Routing table — read these when the trigger fires

| When you're about to... | Read |
|---|---|
| commit — pick the review tier, run its one local pass | `principles/local-review.md` |
| branch, open a PR, answer review, merge, recover from `no-commit-to-branch`, work with stacked PRs, or fan out worktrees | `principles/git-workflow.md` |
| understand the AI-authored change lifecycle or PR review loop architecture | `principles/ai-delivery-architecture.md` |
| start a non-trivial code change | `principles/pre-implementation-checklist.md` |
| understand the *why* of a daily-reminder rule | `principles/engineering-principles.md` |
| edit, write, or audit documentation | `principles/documentation-ownership.md` |
| coordinate parallel agents (subagents or worktrees) | `principles/agent-swarms.md` |
| audit a structural bug class after fixing one instance | `principles/audit-weak-points.md` |
| hit a bug in an upstream tool (don't silently work around it) | `principles/file-upstream-bugs.md` |
| write, trust, or audit agent memory — it is a cache, not truth | `principles/memory-hygiene.md` |

Claude Code agents: the bundled `touchstone-*` and `memory-audit` skills mirror this table in your session header; `touchstone steering install` keeps them current. Trust whichever surface fires first.

## Authoring Guide

You are maintaining the standard baseline for a solo developer directing many agents across many projects. Touchstone ships two things, and both are the product: the guidance prompts an agent reads, and the small script surface that makes the agent use GitHub correctly. A bug here is a bug in how every project ships.

### Git Workflow

- Start each code change from a feature branch. Before editing tracked files, run `git branch --show-current`; if it reports `main` or `master`, branch with `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>`.
- Claim every configured-tracker item before editing or dispatching an agent.
  Touchstone uses Linear: assign the `AUT-N` item through Linear's API/MCP and
  verify the surviving assignee. An unavailable transport is not verification.
- Keep changes logically grouped. Stage explicit file paths, commit with a concise message, and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Reconcile configured-tracker state before opening the PR. Touchstone fixes
  put `Fixes AUT-N` in the **PR body**; linked GitHub issues remain evidence, not
  a competing execution plan. A commit trailer alone does not survive every
  squash merge.
- Ship with `git push -u origin HEAD`, then use `bash bin/touchstone pr open` with the reviewed title and body, and `--expect-branch <the branch you created in step 2>` — write the name out, never `$(git branch --show-current)`, which reads the same checkout the command does and so agrees with a wrong worktree; merge with `bash bin/touchstone pr merge <n> --head <reviewed-sha>`. The source commands sequence GitHub and verify surviving state; `principles/git-workflow.md` carries their raw recovery equivalents.
- The PR is the review surface. Do not treat PR creation as completion: answer every piece of PR feedback and resolve its thread — whoever left it — before merging.
- File-writing subagents use isolated worktrees by default. Follow `principles/agent-swarms.md`; use `git worktree add` and `git worktree remove` for setup and teardown.

### Touchstone-Specific Rules

- **A rule must live at the layer that can enforce it.** GitHub enforces, prose instructs, scripts observe and sequence. Nothing lives at two layers at once. Re-deciding locally what GitHub decides at the merge button is the specific mistake that grew this repo to 49,000 lines.
- **Adoption must stay set-and-forget.** Consumer repositories carry declarations and narrow integration points, never copied Touchstone implementation. An adopted repository remains valid without routine rewrites; evolution is backward-compatible or an explicit reviewable upgrade. `docs/product-contract.md` is the canonical boundary.
- **Delete by default.** The burden of proof is on keeping. A change earns its way in when a real failure demanded it, not because a review round suggested it.
- **Portfolio scope is checked-in data.** Before adding an adoption detector, commit the supported repository shapes and real generated artifacts that justify it. An absent or ambiguous shape uses the manual plan; it does not earn a speculative parser.
- Never restate a volatile inventory. Name the invariant and the file that owns the facts; a list of which projects, commands, flags, or steps are in what state goes stale in place and still reads as current.
- A downstream project is not fixed from here, whatever its state. Read whether one is adopted from the project itself — `touchstone adopt --check`, and `touchstone policy status` for what GitHub enforces — never from a list in this file, and never from whether `policy/github/consumers/` holds an entry: it carries a file only where policy varies from the canonical one, so absence proves nothing. Re-adoption is always a separate, tracked decision.
- All shell must stay portable to macOS. The base tool surface is `bash`, `git`, `gh`, `sed`, and `awk`; policy operations additionally use `jq`, which `setup.sh` installs and verifies.

### Testing

Before pushing, run the smallest deterministic test files that exercise the
changed behavior and the pre-commit checks for the changed files. Do not rerun
the complete suite as confirmation: the protected hosted workflow pinned
by `policy/github/touchstone-main.json` owns that proof through the single
`.touchstone.toml` command. The suite stays deterministic, offline, and free of
live model/provider quota. Do not add a duplicate target-repository validation
workflow — a required check that can go red because a package host had a bad
minute is not a gate (#742, #803, #808).

This optimization applies only while effective policy contains that protected
workflow. If it is absent, run the complete suite locally and track the rollout
gap; missing enforcement never authorizes missing validation.

Lint is not part of the test suite. It runs at pre-commit and via `pre-commit run --all-files`: `shellcheck`, `shfmt`, `markdownlint`, and `actionlint`.

## Review Guide

You are reviewing pull requests for the **touchstone** repo — the baseline that governs how every project ships. A bug here becomes a bug everywhere.

---

## What to prioritize (in order)

1. **Layer violations.** Does the change re-implement something GitHub already decides — a merge condition, a review verdict, a branch rule? That is the mistake this repo exists to stop repeating. A script may observe and report what GitHub said; it may not adjudicate.
2. **Script portability.** All scripts must work on macOS (zsh default) with standard tools (`bash`, `git`, `gh`, `sed`, `awk`). No Linux-only flags, no GNU-specific extensions without fallbacks.
3. **Prose accuracy.** Steering docs must not name a file that does not exist, or describe a mechanism nothing implements. Prose that instructs an agent to run a deleted script is worse than no prose — the agent follows it and the failure looks like the agent's fault.
4. **Merge-gate integrity.** The required check must not gain a third-party network dependency. Head binding at merge (`--match-head-commit`) must not be dropped.
5. **Principle accuracy.** Changes to `principles/*.md` should reflect genuinely universal engineering standards. Project-specific advice doesn't belong here.

Style nits and theoretical refactors are **out of scope**.

---

## Specific review rules

### High-scrutiny paths

Files: `policy/github/touchstone-main.json`, `hooks/branch-guard.sh`, `scripts/respond-review.sh`, `TOUCHSTONE.md`

Flag any of the following:

- **A new dependency on the merge path.** The pinned external validation workflow must remain deterministic and offline. The target repository must not add a duplicate validation workflow.
- **Unpinned actions.** Every GitHub Action must be pinned to a full commit SHA, not a tag. Only a SHA is immutable.
- **Missing error handling.** Scripts use `set -euo pipefail`. Commands that can fail legitimately must be guarded explicitly, never silently.
- **Path assumptions.** Never assume the repo root is a specific directory. Derive paths from `$0` or `git rev-parse`.

### Self-tests

- Every behavioral change needs an assertion that fails on the old code.
- New assertions should join an existing test file rather than fragmenting into new ones.

---

## What NOT to flag

- Formatting, whitespace, import order.
- "You could refactor this for clarity" — only if the unclarity hides a bug.
- Missing comments on straightforward shell commands.
- Speculative future-proofing.
- **Arguing a deleted file back in.** A finding that says "you might need this" is not evidence. Deletions are recoverable from git history; the admission test is a real failure, not a hypothetical.

---

## Output format

1. **Summary** — what this PR does and your verdict.
2. **Blocking issues** — file:line, what's wrong, suggested fix.
3. **Non-blocking observations** — brief.
4. **Tests** — do the self-tests pass?

If there are zero blocking issues: "LGTM."
