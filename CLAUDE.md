# Touchstone — Claude Code Instructions

## Who You Are on This Project

You are maintaining the standard baseline for a solo developer directing many agents across many projects. Touchstone ships two things, and both are the product: the **guidance prompts** an agent reads to know how to work, and the **push scripts** that make the agent use GitHub correctly. Quality matters doubly — a bug here is a bug in how every project ships.

Codex and other AGENTS.md-native tools read `AGENTS.md`; Gemini CLI reads `GEMINI.md`. Keep `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` aligned when workflow, architecture, or hard-won lessons change.

## Universal steering

The universal contract is `TOUCHSTONE.md`. `touchstone steering install` puts it in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so it is already loaded here on any machine with the install; this file does not import it a second time. If `/context` lists no Touchstone steering block under Memory files, read `TOUCHSTONE.md` before the first edit.

Codex and Gemini read the same block through the managed markers in `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`. **Edit `TOUCHSTONE.md`, then run `bash scripts/render-steering.sh`**; `tests/test-steering-render.sh` fails on drift.

## Touchstone-Specific Principles

- **A rule must live at the layer that can enforce it.** GitHub enforces (rulesets, required checks). Prose instructs. Scripts observe and sequence — they never adjudicate. Nothing may live at two layers at once. Re-deciding locally what GitHub decides at the merge button is what grew this repo to 49,000 lines; it is the specific mistake to not repeat.
- **Adoption must stay set-and-forget.** Consumer repositories carry declarations and narrow integration points, never copied Touchstone implementation. An adopted repository remains valid without routine rewrites; evolution is backward-compatible or an explicit reviewable upgrade. `docs/product-contract.md` is the canonical boundary.
- **Delete by default.** The burden of proof is on keeping. A deletion is recoverable from git history; a file kept on "it might be useful" accretes tests, findings, and dependents. A change earns its way in when a real failure demanded it — not because a review round suggested it.
- **Self-tests are mandatory.** Run focused deterministic tests for changed behavior before pushing. The protected hosted workflow owns the complete suite; do not repeat it locally as confirmation. If effective policy lacks that workflow, run the complete suite locally and track the rollout gap.
- **Never restate a volatile inventory.** Name the invariant and the file that owns the facts; a list of which projects, commands, flags, or steps are in what state goes stale in place, and reads as current until someone audits it. This line replaced one that named four frozen downstream projects long after three of them had adopted Touchstone 3.
- **A downstream project is not fixed from here, whatever its state.** A project still on committed copies of the old scripts keeps working because no stripped release reaches it; an adopted one carries its own declarations and is reached by the installed tool. Read which it is from its `.touchstone.toml` and `policy/github/consumers/`, never from a list in this file. Re-adoption is always a separate, tracked decision.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/respond-review.sh` (`touchstone pr answer`) | Reply to a review finding and resolve its thread in one step (GitHub needs four API calls) |
| `scripts/touchstone-tracker.sh` | Versioned tracker-neutral verified claim adapter |
| `scripts/touchstone-pr.sh` | Source entrypoint for the `open`/`status`/`merge` PR operations (`answer` lives in `respond-review.sh`) |
| `scripts/claim-issue.sh` | GitHub transport used by the tracker adapter |
| `hooks/branch-guard.sh` | Refuses `git commit` on the default branch at the Claude tool boundary |
| `tests/test-steering-size-caps.sh` | Steering size caps plus path integrity — every path the docs name must exist |

Release history lives in `git log` and `gh release list`; there is no `CHANGELOG.md`, deliberately (`principles/documentation-ownership.md`).

## Delivery

The installed CLI is the sequencer everywhere; raw `git` and `gh` are the
documented recovery path. In this source checkout,
`bash bin/touchstone pr open|status|merge|answer`
exercises the four bounded operations (`answer` replies to a finding, records
its disposition, resolves its thread, and — under gate behavior contract 3 —
posts the one idempotent attest request when the last thread resolves);
`docs/pr-cli-contract.md` records their stable schema and exact raw
equivalents. Pass `--expect-branch <branch>` to `open` with the branch name written out:
it acts on whatever branch the invoking directory has checked out, which
differs per worktree. Never derive it from `$(git branch --show-current)` —
that reads the same checkout the command reads, so it agrees with a wrong
worktree and binds nothing.

## Distribution

Releases are tag-driven and Homebrew-distributed; a release is a name for reviewed state, never a new state. The cut procedure, the non-Homebrew installer, and the hook-by-name rule for consumer settings live in `README.md` under Distribution. Homebrew upgrades the installed tool only and never mutates a repository. The tool version and the project-contract schema are separate lines; see `docs/product-contract.md`.
