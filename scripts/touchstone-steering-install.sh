# scripts/touchstone-steering-install.sh — put the universal contract where
# every agent on this machine reads it.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/touchstone-steering-install.sh install [--home DIR] [--dry-run] [--non-interactive]
#   bash scripts/touchstone-steering-install.sh check   [--home DIR]
#   bash scripts/touchstone-steering-install.sh state   [--home DIR]
#   bash scripts/touchstone-steering-install.sh uninstall [--home DIR]
#
# `managed` is the upgrader's read-only ownership probe. It is deliberately
# not a user-facing steering mode: exit 0 means this tool already owns at
# least one managed block, and exit 1 means confirmed absent.
#
# Steering was the only Touchstone layer that propagated by copying. Merge
# rules live in one GitHub ruleset, the validation workflow in one pinned SHA,
# tool logic in one Homebrew formula — but the contract itself was pasted into
# every consumer, so every edit meant a pull request per repository. Measured
# 2026-08-18: zero of ten consumer copies matched, and several instructed
# agents to do what the contract forbids.
#
# This installs it once per machine instead. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini
# each read a user-level instruction file and layer project files over it, so
# a managed block there reaches every repository at once and a project keeps
# the last word.
#
# The block is delimited, idempotent, and never touches a byte outside its
# markers. Content you wrote in those files is yours.
